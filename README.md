ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Oditi Agarwal, a passionate second-year B.Tech student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. 
As an aspiring full-stack developer, I'm honing my skills through various projects and internships. I have experience working with languages like Python, Java, and SQL, and I'm proficient in frameworks and technologies such as JPA, Hibernate, and MongoDB. I've completed an internship at CodeAlpha, where I developed an expense tracker application and tackled several challenging tasks. I'm also working on a Task Management System that incorporates dependency injection and uses JdbcTemplate for database connectivity.
I enjoy solving problems with algorithms, such as Prim's for minimum spanning tree, and I'm excited to apply my skills in practical scenarios. Outside of coding, I love brainstorming event ideas for Club Yukti and exploring opportunities like the METI Japan Internship Program. 
Feel free to connect with me to collaborate on projects .
